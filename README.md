# Udacity Nanodegrees

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) offers some great content in their
[Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) programs. If you don't have
the money, and/or just don't want to pay for them, you can take many of the
courses for free.

While it's no substitute for the actual Nanodegree programs
(which include project reviews, additional student and career guidance, and a
job guarantee) there is some great content available for learning.

NOTE: I have NO affiliation with Udacity
