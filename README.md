# Udacity Nanodegrees

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) offers some great content in their
[Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) programs. If you don't have
the money, and/or just don't want to pay for them, you can take many of the
courses for free.

While it's no substitute for the actual Nanodegree programs
(which include project reviews, additional student and career guidance, and a
job guarantee) there is some great content available for learning.

NOTE: I have NO affiliation with Udacity

## Why are only some of the Nanodegrees listed here?

The focus of this project has always been making learning accessible. As
such, I've chosen to only only list Nanodegrees with free content. All of
the Nanodegrees programs listed here meet the following criteria:

* Nanodegree lists syllabus on it's public-facing (non-logged in) page
* Links to each course in the syllabus are available on the public-facing Nanodegree page
* Individual courses are available to take for free via their public facing course page

Lately, as Udacity adds more and more great (and relevent) programs, the
newer Nanodegrees haven't been listing the courses and/or linking to them and
this list hasn't been updated as frequently.

### What about pull requests, I'd like to contribute?

Awesome! As long as your PR meets the same 3 criteria in the last section.

I am aware that some of the listed Nanodegrees offer a different/newer syllabus to
their paid students. I'm still deciding how I want to handle that here. If you've
had a PR closed because of this, I will contact you directly.

#### Are you really taking donations? You're barely even updating this anymore!?!

Yeah, yeah. I hear ya. When I first created this project there were no links
to donate. They were only added after receiving a surprising amount of requests
from very kind people who found the project useful and asked for them.
